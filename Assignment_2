Q1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them? 
Ans: True and False, using capital T and F, with the rest of the word in lowercase. 

Q2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators? 
Ans: and, or, and not. 
and:- this is used to get two Booleans and check whether they are both True. 

Or:- this is used to get the second value if the first one is false. If the first one is true, it gets  The first one. 

Not:- this is used to  invert the Boolean value. Gets the opposite value! 

Q3. Make a list of each Boolean operator’s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ). 
Ans:  
True and True = True. 
True and False = False. 
False and True = False. 
False and False = False. 
True or True = True. 
True or False = True. 
False or True = True. 
False or False = False. 
not True = False. 
not False = True. 

Q4. What are the values of the following expressions? 
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)  
not (5 > 4) 
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) 
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) 
(True and True) and (True == False) 
(not False) or (not True) 
Ans: 
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) =  False 
not (5 > 4) = False 
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)  = True 
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) = False 
(True and True) and (True == False) = False 
(not False) or (not True) = True 

Q5. What are the six comparison operators? 
Ans: these are six comparison operators:- 
1. == 
2.  != 
3. < 
4.  > 
5. <=  
6.  >= 

Q6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators? Describe a condition and when you would use one. 
Ans: == is the equal to operator that compares two values and evaluates to a Boolean, 
while = is the assignment operator that stores a value in a variable. 
A condition is an expression used in a flow control statement that evaluates to a Boolean value 

Q7. Identify the three blocks in this code: 
spam = 0 
if spam == 10: 
print(‘eggs’) 
if spam > 5: 
print(‘bacon’) 
else: 
print(‘ham') 
print(‘spam') 
print('spam’) 
Ans:  
First Block: 
if spam == 10: 
print(‘eggs’) 

Second Block: 
if spam > 5: 
print(‘bacon’) 

Third Block: 
else: 
print(‘ham') 
print(‘spam') 
print('spam’) 

Q8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam. 
Ans: 
if spam == 1: 
print('Hello') 
elif spam == 2: 
print('Howdy') 
else: 
print('Greetings!') 

Q9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press? 
Ans:- I don’t Know this answer. 

Q10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue? 
Ans:  With break we are out of the loop and with continue we come to the starting point of the loop. 

Q11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)? 
Ans: The range(10) call ranges from 0 up to (but not including) 10, range(0, 10) explicitly tells the 
loop to start at 0, and range(0, 10, 1) explicitly tells the loop to increase the variable by 1 on each iteration. 

Q12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop. 
Ans:  
for i in range(1,11): 
print(i) 
and: 
i = 1 
while i <= 10: 
print(i) 
i = i + 1 

Q13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam? 
Ans: spam.bacon().
