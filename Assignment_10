Q3.What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?

while shutil functions will permanently delete files and folders.

Q4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is
equivalent to File objects’ open() method?

and the second argument is the mode to open the ZIP file in (read, write, or append).

Q5.Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf
or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.
ans:
import os, shutil
def selectiveCopy(folder, extensions, destFolder):
	folder = os.path.abspath(folder)
	destFolder = os.path.abspath(destFolder)
	print('Looking in', folder, 'for files with extensions of', ', '.join(extensions))
	for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(folder):
		for filename in filenames:
			name, extension = os.path.splitext(filename)
			if extension in extensions:
				fileAbsPath = foldername + os.path.sep + filename
				print('Coping', fileAbsPath, 'to', destFolder)
				shutil.copy(fileAbsPath, destFolder)

extensions = ['.php', '.py']
folder = 'randomFolder'
destFolder = 'selectiveFolder'
selectiveCopy(folder, extensions, destFolder)
