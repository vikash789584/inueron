Q1.In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*
'hello'
-87.8
-
/
+
6
ans: 
Operator:- +,-,*,/
Values:- 'hello',-87.8

Q2.What is the difference between string and variable?
ans:- Variables are symbols that you can use to store data in a program and a String is a type of information you would store in a Variable
example:-
a=input("Enter Yoyr name") # a is variable
a="Hello my name is Deepak kumar" #Hello my name is Deepak kumar is string

Q3.Describe three different data type.
ans:- 
1.Number data type: 
They are immutable data type, this means that you can not change it's value.
three different Numeric data type available in python:
1.Integer
ex:
a=20
2.Float
ex:
b=20.5
3.Complex
ex:
c=2+3j
2.String data type:
Strings are sequence of one or more character strings
ex:
a="Hello my name is vikash"
3.Boolean data type:
It is a data type that returns a value of True and False when the program is run correctly.
ex:
one = True
two = False

print(type(one))
print(type(two))

Q4.what is an expression made up of what do all expressions do?
ans:An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value. 
In any programming language, an expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators.
I am just writing  the names and examples of some expressions.
1. Constant Expressions:
x = 15 + 1.3
print(x)
2. Arithmetic Expressions:
ex:
+       x + y	Addition
–	x – y	Subtraction
*	x * y	Multiplication
/	x / y	Division
//	x // y	Quotient
%	x % y	Remainder
**	x ** y	Exponentiation
3. Integral Expressions: 
ex:
a = 13
b = 12.0 
c = a + int(b)
print(c)

Q5.This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
ans: An expression evaluates to a single value. A statement does not.

Q6.After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
ans:The bacon variable is set to 20. The bacon + 1 expression does not reassign the value in bacon (that would need an assignment statement: bacon = bacon + 1)

Q7.What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam'*3
ans:Both expressions evaluate to the string 'spamspamspam'.

Q8.Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
ans: eggs a valid variable yes but 100 is not a valid variable name because variable name is can not start with a number.

Q9.What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
ans:The int(), float(), and str() functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number or string version of a value.

Q10.Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos'
ans:This is not the correct way because with string + only string appends.
The expression causes an error because 99 is an integer, and only strings can be concatenated to other strings with the + operator. 
The correct way is I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'.
